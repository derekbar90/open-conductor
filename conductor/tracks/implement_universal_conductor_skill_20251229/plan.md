# Plan: Implement Universal Conductor Agent Skill

## Phase 1: Universal Skill Scaffolding [checkpoint: d774ffe]
- [x] Task: Create skill directory structure `.agent/skills/conductor/references/` (a0c4beb)
- [x] Task: Draft initial `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (d3bcc9c)
- [x] Task: Implement "Discovery" instructions in `SKILL.md` (4713fc7)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Universal Skill Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md) (d774ffe)

## Phase 2: Protocol Implementation
- [x] Task: Draft `references/protocol.md` with detailed Spec/Plan/Implement steps (08a2b72)
- [x] Task: Add "Execution" instructions to `SKILL.md` linking to references (36eb30b)
- [ ] Task: Implement state-checking logic (ensure agent looks for `conductor/product.md`)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Protocol Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: OpenSkills & AGENTS.md Integration
- [ ] Task: Initialize `AGENTS.md` with OpenSkills XML tags
- [ ] Task: Add `openskills sync` instructions to the workflow/skill
- [ ] Task: Verify skill triggers via a simulated agent request
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Integration and Final Review' (Protocol in workflow.md)
